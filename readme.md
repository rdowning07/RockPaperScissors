# Rock • Paper • Scissors

A SwiftUI learning project as instructed by [Paul Hudson’s 100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui).

---

## 🎯 Overview

This app was built as part of my **Technical Program Manager journey** at Amazon, combining hands-on coding practice with architectural learning.  
The project uses SwiftUI’s modern declarative design to create a simple game loop for **Rock–Paper–Scissors** — complete with scoring, match length selection, and restart logic.

---

## 🧠 Learning Objectives
- Understand and apply `@State` for dynamic UI updates.
- Use SwiftUI’s **NavigationStack**, **Toolbar**, and **Material backgrounds** to create app-like structure.
- Apply modular arithmetic to simplify conditional logic.
- Manage persistent UI state across rounds and restarts.
- Follow Apple’s **Human Interface Guidelines** for layout and typography.

---

## ⚙️ Features
- Large navigation title and toolbar
- System-styled cards with `.regularMaterial`
- Segmented control for “Best Of” match length
- Dynamic scoring (player vs system)
- Reset button for new matches
- Fully responsive, single-screen layout

---

## 💡 Technologies
- Swift 6 / SwiftUI 5
- Xcode 26
- SF Symbols
- Apple Material Design System

## 🤝 Acknowledgements
Created in partnership with **GPT-5**, acting as a technical and design thought partner to accelerate architecture, UI iteration, and learning alignment with Amazon TPM skill goals.  
Original instructional framework by **Paul Hudson (Hacking with Swift)**.

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Add subtle animations and haptic feedback
- Expand to two-player local play
- Add scoreboard persistence via `@AppStorage`
